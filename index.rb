# Core:
# #The below steps must be done in order.
# * Create a directory called hello_git
# * Create an index.rb file inside the directory, and puts “Hello world!” in this file
# * Change into the hello_git directory and run ‘git status’
# * It says it is not a git repository. Initialise this directory as a repo
# * Add everything in your directory to your GitHub repo
# * Commit these changes - be sure to write a meaningful message
# * Push this commit to GitHub
# * Create a new branch with whatever name you’d like
# * Create a new file called README.md and put an explanation of your project into this file
# * Add, commit and push this branch 
# * Go to Github and merge the pull request
# * Back on your local machine, change back to your master branch and pull these new changes down
# * When successful, delete the branch you created, so you should only have master left
# * Add another file called this_was_a_mistake.rb and add some text into it
# * You should never push to master, so take your changes with you and create another branch with a new name
# * Add, commit, push these changes
# * Back on GitHub, complete a pull request
# * On your local machine, change back to master, delete your old branch, and pull down the changes.
# * Oh drat! We don’t want the file this_was_a_mistake.rb! Rollback to your previous commit!
# * Turn to the person next to you, follow them on GitHub and work out how you can clone their repository (and let them clone yours)
# * Make some modifications to their repo, and add, commit and push up
# * Turn to the person on the other side and fork their repo
# * Make some changes, and add, commit and push up

puts "Hello World!"
